# OpenSim-based full-body multibody model built in Artisynth
This repository holds the current state of a full-body model based on the OpenSim model published by [Tim Dorn](https://simtk.org/frs/?group_id=433). The model was built using the freely available 3D modelling platform [ArtiSynth](https://www.artisynth.org/Main/HomePage). Additional artisynth models published by the developers can be found here: [artisynth_models](https://github.com/artisynth/artisynth_models). 

The model is intended for combined multi-body and finite element simulations and contains contact and constraint definitions.

If you use the model or parts of it in your research, please cite the following reference:

The image shows the generated multibody model controlled by Inverse Kinematics. Notice, that the ground-pelvis joint was removed in this model, since it is unnecessary in Artisynth. Ground reaction forces are available, but incorporation is still under development.
