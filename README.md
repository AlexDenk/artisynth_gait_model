# OpenSim-based full-body multibody model built in Artisynth
This repository holds the current state of a full-body model based on the OpenSim model published by [Tim Dorn](https://simtk.org/frs/?group_id=433). The model was built using the freely available 3D modelling platform [ArtiSynth](https://www.artisynth.org/Main/HomePage). Additional artisynth models published by the developers can be found here: [artisynth_models](https://github.com/artisynth/artisynth_models). 

The model is intended for combined multibody-finite element simulations subject to contact and constraint definitions. It contains muscles and a tracking controller, that solves for muscle activations based on experimental marker trajectories and ground reaction forces. As this project and research progresses we are continuously improving and updating this model and are open to suggestions for improvements and new potential applications.

If you use the model or parts of it in your research, please cite the following reference:

The image shows the generated multibody model controlled by experimental marker trajectories and forces. Experimental forces are applied to the calcaneus. The inverse simulation solves for muscle activations, that lead to the observed movement. Tracking errors of the derived movements are in the range of 0.02 m.
